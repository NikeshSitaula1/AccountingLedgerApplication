I have created an instance variable, id for my Ledger class, thinking it would be
necessary for this project. However, I later realized that the application did not
require the id field. So, I did not want to create a function to call the id, but
leaving it alone would mean my object not working as it is tied to it. As such, instead of removing the id,
I decided to auto generate ids based on current size of the transactions list with ```transactions.size() + 1```.This
allowed me to keep track of entries, allowing each new entry to get a unique. incremental id automatically.
The problem of doing this way tho, is that, if an item is deleted from the transactions list, it will no
longer remain sequential and there will be unused ids.

- Latest update replaces the arraylist.size() + 1 to get an automatic ID with UUID, a much better way to get a unique ID.
- Thank you to all the feedback on my presentation for this update.
